# Homework 3
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)
```

## Problem 1
```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```
To that end, write a short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the data, describing some key variables, and giving illstrative examples of observations.

The instacart dataset is comprised of `r nrow(instacart)` observations and `r ncol(instacart)` variables. 

```{r}
aisle_count <- instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```
There are a total of `count(aisle_count)` aisles, and the top 6 aisles where the most items are ordered from are fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, packaged vegetables fruits, yogurt, packcaged cheese, and water seltzer sparkling water.
